hate this to blood, thought of every little detail, and in the end forgot how to use data that you already have, to remember things for implementation
need to mark every row and line, easy can have a set of lines and rows to zerodown, but actually can easilly right that down right in the first row and line, need to remeber line and row had any zeroes in them O(1) memory
