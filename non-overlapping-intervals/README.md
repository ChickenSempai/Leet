<h2>435. Non-overlapping Intervals</h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given an array of intervals <code>intervals</code> where <code>intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code>, return <em>the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping</em>.</p>

Firstly had no idea what to do, tried thinkinh of algorithmss that only i can make sense of, felt that i'm making a mistake, after some consideration, thought of really slow algorithm, that worked. Checked solutions time complexity for a hint, found out that the best algorithm provides O(nlogn). Good algorithm is greedy with lexicographic sorting,and simple idea - everything behind is already solved, only what can be in further counts.
